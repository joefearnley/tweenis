**05.03.2013**: As of the 1.1 version of the Twitter API, they have dropped support for
client-side javascript. In order to authenticate to the API you must do
so server side. Since this application runs off [Github
Pages](http://pages.github.com/), this can't be done and I don't feel
like moving it to a server. So this is the end. It was fun while it
lasted.
